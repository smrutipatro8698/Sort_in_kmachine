# Sort_in_kmachine
This repository contains a sorting algorithm implemented in the k-machine model
n: no. of elements to be sorted
k: no. of machines
The input numbers are generated uniformly at random between [1,100]
To run the code, run the command: python q6.py -n <no. of elements> -k <no. of machines>
To see the input numbers, include the flag -input, i.e. run: python q6.py -n <no. of elements> -k <no. of machines> -input
To see the output numbers in each machine after sorting, include the flag -output, i.e. run: python q6.py -n <no. of elements> -k <no. of machines> -output
To see both the input and output run: python q6.py -n <no. of elements> -k <no. of machines> -input -output

Example, run: python q6.py -n 1000 -k 4 -input -output
